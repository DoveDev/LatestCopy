# LatestCopy
v2.0.0 of LatestCopy allows the user to create a .zip archive of a Crestron based project, capturing a number of the critical file types for publishing or backing up. # The Default Search Directory is $env:USERPROFILE\Crestron\ (or C:\Users\USERNAME\Crestron) and can be changed when prompted. # The Default Destination for a copy is $env:USERPROFILE\Crestron\Temp-PackageProject (or C:\Users\USERNAME\Crestron\Temp-PackageProject) and can be changed when prompted. # The resulting .zip archive will have the name of the destination folder (e.g. Temp-PackageProject.zip). # If the file Temp-PackageProject.zip already exists you will be required to move or delete this before continuing (A prompt for deletion and archiving will be given).
